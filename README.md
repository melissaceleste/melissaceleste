## Hi, I'm Melissa ðŸ––

Iâ€™m a **Full Stack Developer** with **4 years of experience**, passionate about building intuitive and creative digital products.  
My main focus lies in **TypeScript**, **React**, and **PHP/Symfony**, but I enjoy working across the entire stack.

I love solving complex problems with clean code, learning new technologies, and bringing a touch of creativity to everything I build.

ðŸ’¡ From my start at the [neuefische coding bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/) to now, itâ€™s been a journey full of curiosity, growth, and a lot of code.  

ðŸŒ± Currently expanding my skills in **advanced frontend architecture** and exploring **design systems**.
